### Overview

A classic character creation mod by Whaley, this mod adds new hairstyles, tattoos, nakeup and cosmetic injuries to [Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/).

As of this writing, it has been almost two years since Whaley's mod was released in 2019. Since then, it has not gotten any updates and the format for Cataclysm mods has changed a bit. 

I have gone through and updated the relevant json items so that this mod now works properly with release 0.F. This mod will work with the two default MSX-series tilesets provided by mainline without you having to go in and fuck around with the various json files contained in this mod yourself.

**This repository was not made by, endorsed by, or otherwise associated with Whaley in any way. No sprites or artwork has been edited for this release. This is purely a compability patch for modern game versions. This repository was created in the absence of any official patch to this great mod. If Whaley chooses to update this mod ever then you should go download from them instead of downloading from me.**

### Installation

1. Copy the **Whaleys Hair and Tattoo** folder to your cddaroot**/data/mods/** folder.
2. Activate **Whaley's Hair & Tattoo - 0.F** in the graphical mods category of new world creation.
3. Create a new character and use the added options in the trait selection screen.

This mod is intended for use with player models from MSXotto+ and its derivative tilesets. 

At this time, only MSXotto+ and ChibiUltica are in the tiles compatibility list for this mod because are the only mainlined MSXotto+ series tilesets.

If you would like to use this mod with that other guy's tileset that will never be included in mainline, please add his tileset to the compatibility list in **mod_tileset.json** or this mod will not work for you.
