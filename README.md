# Whaley's Hair and Tattoo - Unofficial 0.G Release

![Whaley's Hair and Tattoo](overview.png)

### Overview

This repo is an unofficial fork of the [classic character creation mod by Whaley](https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/dvxkr4/whaleys_hair_tattoo_mod/), established with the intent of keeping Whaley's mod alive for newer releases of [Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/).

This mod adds new hairstyles, tattoos, makeup, and cosmetic injuries to further customise the visual appearance of your characters.

### Installation

1. Copy the **Whaleys Hair and Tattoo** folder from this repository to your CDDA `/data/mods/` folder.
2. Activate **Whaley's Hair & Tattoo - 0.G** in the graphical mods category of new world creation.
3. Create a new character. The new cosmetics will be available in the trait selection screen.

This mod is intended for use with player models from MSXotto+ and its derivative tilesets. 

At this time, only MSXotto+ and ChibiUltica are in the tiles compatibility list for this mod because they are the only mainlined MSXotto+ series tilesets.

If you would like to use this mod with that other guy's tileset that will never be included in mainline, please add his tileset to the compatibility list in `mod_tileset.json` or this mod will not work for you.
