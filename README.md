![Whaley's Hair and Tattoo](https://i.redd.it/2vtebwm1hiy31.png)

### Overview

A classic character creation mod by Whaley: this mod adds new hairstyles, tattoos, makeup, and cosmetic injuries to [Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/).

[Whaley released this mod](https://www.reddit.com/r/cataclysmdda/comments/dvxkr4/whaleys_hair_tattoo_mod/) in 2019. Since then, the mod has not received any official updates. 

This repo is an unofficial fork, established with the intent of maintaining compatibility with MSX-series tilesets in newer releases from CleverRaven.

### Installation

1. Copy the **Whaleys Hair and Tattoo** folder from this repository to your CDDA `/data/mods/` folder.
2. Activate **Whaley's Hair & Tattoo - 0.G** in the graphical mods category of new world creation.
3. Create a new character and use the added options in the trait selection screen.

This mod is intended for use with player models from MSXotto+ and its derivative tilesets. 

At this time, only MSXotto+ and ChibiUltica are in the tiles compatibility list for this mod because they are the only mainlined MSXotto+ series tilesets.

If you would like to use this mod with that other guy's tileset that will never be included in mainline, please add his tileset to the compatibility list in `mod_tileset.json` or this mod will not work for you.
